# Mystery Sentence Game
A game for two players featuring sentence guess with five rounds with an add on feature of Predict Sentence in advance!
## How to play?

* Load the page and you can play right away by clicking the start button.Alert messages will pop up showing the first turn for the start of game. 
* When user clicks, one of the keyboard values, the function (getString) will call the input array that randomly selects inputs and give it to the display board. 
* We call function disp_board(disp_text) to generate comp boxes equivalent to the number of letters in the sentence.
* Then function (turnCalc) will be called to display the number of turns left for each players in the scoreboard.An empty array is initialized to keep the unique letters in the sentence displayed and we set a counter for that to find the turnCount.
* When user clicks,the function (atclick) is called a value from the keyboard key value is passed through it, and compare the value with each compbox value in the display board,user clicks,and with keyboard.If all these conditions are met, the keycount variable will increase and color of keys will change to goldenrod.
* On the other hand, if keycount not changed, compbox value,keyboard and with user clicks are not matched the color of that button in keyboard will change to grey.
* Compairing the values of keycount and breaker variables, we will decide the points of each rounds to each player.
* The player who wins that round will be receiving points from the other player who lost that round.The winner will be decided by summing up the total in all five rounds and it will be displayed. The winner calculation is done by function (winCalc).
* Also we have an extra feature of 'Predict the sentence button' so that players can guess the sentence in advance without playing all five rounds of game. This will be taking place with function(homeRun).We will initialize two variables,wordsLeft and playCnt and find the differnce between already keys that have goldenrod color and total lengthof compbox, we get turn counts. If the player predicts the sentence within that turns, he will win the game.
* Function (quitGame) is called when someone wants to end the game. When player quits all player1,player2 points in each rounds, display string, compbox values, score board values, each players turns everything will be reset to zero.
# How it works?
* This game uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to run. The Javascript only uses built in functions, and is designed around a game state object. Player input is intercepted via key presses. There is one index.html file, style.css file, app.js file for this game.
# Bugs
1. Points are displayed after the alert message.
2. Game messages not coded for.
3. Repeated click on an already selected letter leads to losing a chance.
